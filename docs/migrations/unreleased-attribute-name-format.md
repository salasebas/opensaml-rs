# Attribute name format on an accepted attribute

This change is unreleased. It applies to the release that first publishes
`AttributeNameFormat`.

No signature changes. Two values that were always empty now carry what the
identity provider sent.

## Compare an accepted attribute with its name format

Who must change: code that compares an `Attribute` from
`SsoSession::attributes` with one it builds, using `==`.

`Attribute::name_format` was `None` on every accepted attribute. It is now the
`NameFormat` URI of the `<Attribute>`, and `None` only when that element has
no `NameFormat`. An attribute built with `Attribute::new(name, None, values)`
is therefore no longer equal to an accepted attribute that has a format.

Build the expected value with its format, or compare the name and the values:

```rust
use saml_rs::{Attribute, AttributeNameFormat, AttributeValue};

let expected = Attribute::with_name_format(
    "mail",
    AttributeNameFormat::Basic,
    vec![AttributeValue::new("alice@example.com")],
);
```

`Attributes::get`, `Attribute::name`, and `Attribute::values` return what they
returned before.

## Expect a new key in the raw login response extract

Who must change: code that compares the whole `FlowResult::extract` of a raw
login response, or that iterates over all of its keys.

The extract gains `attributeNameFormats`: the `Name` and `NameFormat` of each
`<Attribute>`, in document order. Existing keys are unchanged.
