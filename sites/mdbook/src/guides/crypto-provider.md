# Crypto provider

Pick the provider before the first release build. Keep the default unless you need AWS-LC or FIPS.

## Default

```toml
[dependencies]
saml-rs = "0.6"
```

`crypto-bergshamra` selects RustCrypto together with bergshamra's legacy-algorithm, post-quantum, and PKCS#11 capabilities. `saml-rs` initialises that provider before the first crypto operation.

## Check at startup

Call `initialize_crypto_provider` when a bad provider should fail before the first SAML operation.

```rust
fn startup() -> Result<(), saml_rs::SamlError> {
    let provider = saml_rs::initialize_crypto_provider()?;
    assert_ne!(
        provider.fips_status(),
        saml_rs::CryptoFipsStatus::Uninitialized,
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

Initialisation, attestation, unsupported-algorithm, and key-import failures return `SamlError::Crypto`.

## AWS-LC and FIPS

Turn the default features off and enable exactly one of `crypto-rustcrypto`, `crypto-aws-lc`, or `crypto-fips`. Combinations fail at compile time. `--all-features` does not apply.

Bergshamra supports AWS-LC and FIPS on Linux x86_64 and aarch64. The provider tests in this repository run on Linux x86_64.

`crypto-fips` means the selected AWS-LC provider attested FIPS mode. It does not certify the binary or the deployment. In a `crypto-fips` build, a successful `initialize_crypto_provider` reports `CryptoFipsStatus::Active`.

FIPS rejects algorithms outside its approved set, including SHA-1 `RSA_OAEP_MGF1P` key transport and both signing and verifying `RSA_SHA1`. Non-FIPS AWS-LC still verifies inbound RSA-SHA1 Redirect and XML-DSig signatures. AWS-LC covers a narrower set than RustCrypto. The table is bergshamra's [provider capabilities](https://github.com/kushaldas/bergshamra/blob/v0.9.0/docs/provider-capabilities.md).

## Next

The flag list is [Cargo features](../reference/features.md). What the signature adapter already turns on is [XML signatures](../explanation/xml-signature-recommendations.md).
